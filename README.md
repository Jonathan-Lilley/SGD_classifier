# SGD_classifier
A simple stochastic gradient descent based classifier with three options for loss functions: perceptron-loss, log-loss, and hinge-loss. 
The original file contains a basic test to check if the program runs properly.
The file SGD_language_test.py is a program that uses SGD_classifier.py to classify different Germanic languages based on bigrams (two-letter sequences).

This program was implemented as an independent study during summer 2018, supervised by Professor Mans Hulden at University of Colorado Boulder. It is based on code created by Professor Mans Hulden.
